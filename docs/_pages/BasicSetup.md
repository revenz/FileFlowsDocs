The basic setup of FileFlows requires

1. [Creating a Flow](https://github.com/revenz/FileFlows/wiki/Creating-a-Flow)
2. [Creating a Library](https://github.com/revenz/FileFlows/wiki/Creating-a-Library)

Once you have these configured you can explore many other [Plugins](https://github.com/revenz/FileFlows/wiki/Plugins) and their nodes to make many more Flow combination.  

The princiapl is the same
1. Input File
2. Processing nodes or logic nodes to determine the path of the flow
3. Clean up / moving file to final destination
