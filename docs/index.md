FileFlows is an application that lets you process a file through a Flow.

Refer to the [Basic Setup](https://github.com/revenz/FileFlows/wiki/Basic-Setup) to get started.

A Flow lets you process a file in various different ways.   For example move/copy/delete/re-encode audio/video/remove black bars from videos. 

It has a plugin system that allows developers to extend the functionality.
